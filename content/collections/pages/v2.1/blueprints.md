Blueprints are a core feature of Statamic. They let you define the fields used in your entries, taxonomies, etc.

Since Simple Commerce is built upon Entries, it makes heavy use of blueprints. By default, Simple Commerce _enforces_ a couple of fields which it needs to make everything work together.
