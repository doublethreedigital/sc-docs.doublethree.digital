We built Simple Commerce to feel as native as possible to Statamic. We've adopted everything from the flat file approach to not being opinionated over what your front-end looks like.

**But why flat files?** Because they're awesome! Besides the fact that you can [version control them](/knowledge-base/version-control-strategies), it's also a big plus for security as there's no way for hackers to use MySQL Injection to fetch important data from your system.

**And by the way, you have full control over content modeling!** You heard it right, basically the only requirement you need if to have a price field on your products and you're all set. 

**Simple Commerce also has first-party support for popular gateways...** Right now, Stripe and Mollie are officially supported. If you need one that we don't support, it's easy to build your own gateway.

## Limitations
Simple Commerce is pretty lightweight (hence the name). This means it doesn't have as much functionality as likes of Shopify or Craft Commerce.

* No support for multiple tax rates - at the moment, you can only assign a single tax rate per site.
* No first party shipping methods, you have to [create your own](/shipping) per store.
* No reporting functionality (we have it on our roadmap for the future though!)

## Licensing and Support

To use Simple Commerce in a production environment, you'll need to [buy a license from the Statamic Marketplace](https://statamic.com/addons/double-three-digital/simple-commerce).
