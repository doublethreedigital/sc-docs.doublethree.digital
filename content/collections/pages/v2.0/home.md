Simple Commerce is a perfectly simple e-commerce solution for Statamic. It allows you to enjoy the benefits of flat-files while giving you the power you need to power small-medium sized e-commerce websites.

**Everything's just an entry.** Literally everything from your products to your orders and coupons are just entries sitting in collections.

**Full power of the front-end.** You're not glued to a set of predefined templates or a certain JavaScript framework, use whatever you need to make your site unique.

**Support for popular gateways.** Out of the box, Simple Commerce has support for some of the popular online payment gateways, including Stripe.

**Full control over the blueprints.** Apart from a title and a price, you can add whatever you'd like to your product blueprint. Same goes for other blueprints. We don't want to invade on your happy developer experience.

## Limitations
Simple Commerce is pretty lightweight, meaning it doesn't have as much functionality as something like Shopify or WooCommerce. So there's a few limitations it has compared to other solutions.

* Simple Commerce doesn't currently support the concept of variants or product additions. It's something we might look at implementing later but we don't have it right now.
* It doesn't support multiple tax rates, everything in your store is stuck to the single tax rate.
* We don't support the ability to create complex shipping rules. All we have are [shipping methods](./shipping).

## Licensing
Simple Commerce is a commercial addon. To use it in production, you'll need to purchase a license from the [Statamic Marketplace](https://statamic.com/addons/double-three-digital/simple-commerce), which costs a one-time fee of $199.
